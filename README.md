# Java-CSV-API
CSV sample program is implemented inside the `CSV_Read_Sample` folder

# Vector-Search

- Vector Search program is implemented in the following folder: `Vector_Search_Sample` 
- The Java program that allows the user to search for a keyword in a *.csv file. The program prompts the user to enter a keyword, reads the input, and then opens a CSV file specified by the file path. It reads the file line by line and checks if each line contains the keyword. If a match is found, it prints the row index and the entire line. Finally, it closes the file and handles any exceptions that may occur during the file reading process.
- Overall, this code demonstrates a simple file handling operation in Java, where a *.csv file is read, and a keyword search is performed on its contents.
